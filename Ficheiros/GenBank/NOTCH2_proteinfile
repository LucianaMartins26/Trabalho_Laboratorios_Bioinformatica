            --------------
            This sequence was finished as follows unless otherwise noted: all
            regions were either double-stranded or sequenced with an alternate
            chemistry or covered by high quality data (i.e., phred quality >=
            30); an attempt was made to resolve all sequencing problems, such
            as compressions and repeats; all regions were covered by at least
            one subclone; and the assembly was confirmed by restriction digest,
            except on the rare occasion of the clone being a YAC.
            The following abbreviations are used to associate primary accession
            numbers given in the feature table with their source databases:
            Em:, EMBL; Sw:, SWISSPROT; Tr:, TREMBL; Wp:, WORMPEP; Information
            on the WORMPEP database can be found at
            http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/C_elegans/wormpep
            This sequence was generated from part of bacterial clone contigs of
            human chromosome 1, constructed by the Sanger Centre Chromosome 1
            Mapping Group.  Further information can be found at
            http://www.sanger.ac.uk/HGP/Chr1
            IMPORTANT: This sequence is not the entire insert of clone
            RP11-114O18. It may be shorter because we sequence overlapping
            sections only once, except for a short overlap.
            During sequence assembly data is compared from overlapping clones.
            Where differences are found these are annotated as variations
            together with a note of the overlapping clone name. Note that the
            variation annotation may not be found in the sequence submission
            corresponding to the overlapping clone, as we submit sequences with
            only a small overlap.
            The true right end of clone RP11-323K8 is at 2000 in this sequence.
            The true right end of clone RP11-114O18 is at 107056 in this
            sequence.
            RP11-114O18 is from the library RPCI-11.1 constructed by the group
            of Pieter de Jong. For further details see
